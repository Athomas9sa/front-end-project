## Miscellaneous 

Decorated our personal VSCode program to ensure accuracy of our code while writing.
Used Trello as our guide for completing tasks from: To Do, To Doing, To Done, 
And provided the ability to have up to date comunications for all group members.
Challenge for this project was segregation of individual tasks to members. 
Colaborating on LiveShare VSCode worked easier.
